# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Initialize a Git repository
git init

# Add all changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

# Push the changes to GitHub (replace 'main' with your branch name if needed)
git push -u origin main


Please replace placeholders like path/to/your/project, your-username, your-repository, and main with your actual project path, GitHub username, repository name, and branch name if different.

Copy and paste these commands into your terminal in Visual Studio Code, and they will guide you through the process of initializing a Git repository, making an initial commit, connecting to your GitHub repository, and pushing your project. If it's your first push, GitHub may prompt you for authentication. 
Follow the instructions to complete the process.
